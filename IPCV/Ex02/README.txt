4b) Visually no significant differences can be noted
How many bits per pixel are required to store the YCbCr images directly for S = 2, 4, and 8, if
each channel uses 8 bits? Remember that an RGB image typically uses 24 bits per pixel.

1) S= 2:
Y- channel still has 8 bits
others 8/2 = 4 bits per pixel for Cb and Cr
So, 16 bits per pixel
2) S=4
Y- 8 bits
for Cb and Cr 8/4 =2 bits
12 bits overall
3) S = 8
Y- bits
for Cb and Cr 8/8 = 1 bit
10 bits overall
